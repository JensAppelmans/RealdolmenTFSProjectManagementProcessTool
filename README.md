# RealdolmenTFSProjectManagementProcessTool
This a project I had to make at my intership at Realdolmen with 2 other students.

Because the project is property of the company Realdolmen I can't upload the code to this repository. 
Therefore I uploaded the report I wrote at the end of my internship. 
So please read the report if you want more information about the project. 

Used technologies: 

-React Front-end
-ASP.NET Core Web API Backend and speaking to the databse
-CouchDB (NoSQL) for the database
-Azure for renting Linux sever to host the database
